# CaesarCipher
 The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies.
 It's simply a type of substitution cipher, each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
 For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.
